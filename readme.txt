Setup:
Extract files from .tgz file and copy contents to appropriate directory like 
/usr/local/bin.  tplook and tplook.py need to exist in the same directory. 

Add executable permission to copied tplook.

e.g. chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tplook

Set PATH to include the directory where tplook was installed if you'd like
to start without typing full path.

tplook is implemented using modern python like 2.6.  If python on your system
is too old, it may not run.
